title: Causal Learning From Fine-Grained VLM Representations
description: This project explores how fine-grained representations from vision-language models (VLMs) can be leveraged for causal learning in product design. By mining latent embeddings, attributing outcomes to design features, and generating counterfactual variations, I investigate how design choices causally influence customer sentiment and response.
