title: Causal Learning From Fine-Grained Vision Language Model (VLM) Representations 
description: Demonstrating how latent, fine-grained representations from vision-language models (VLMs) can be leveraged for causal learning. In this application, I manipulate product design representations to understand how design choices impact customer sentiment and responses.

Causal Learning From Rich Vision Language Model (VLM) Representations
This project builds on prior work using rich VLM representations (e.g. CLIP) for product understanding. I explore how these embeddings can be used for causal modeling â€” through attribution analysis, latent mining, and targeted counterfactual generation.
